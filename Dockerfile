# Road Track — a branding layer over upstream LubeLogger.
#
# This is deliberately NOT a fork. Upstream ships every hook we need for the
# logo and the theme; the only thing it does not expose is a handful of
# strings compiled into the Razor views, and those are rewritten in the
# browser instead (see docs/how-it-works.md). So all this image does is add
# static files and a small entrypoint.
#
# Bumping upstream: change LUBELOGGER_VERSION, nothing else.
ARG LUBELOGGER_VERSION=v1.7.4
# Overridable ONLY so tools/test_build_guard.sh can rebuild THIS Dockerfile —
# not a copy of it — against a deliberately broken base, and prove the BRAND
# GUARD checks below actually fail it. Nothing in the pipeline sets this.
ARG LUBELOGGER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/hargata/lubelogger:${LUBELOGGER_VERSION}

# LUBELOGGER_LOGO_URL / LUBELOGGER_LOGO_SMALL_URL environment variables (see

# The theme is appended to site.css rather than installed as a LubeLogger
# theme: data/themes/ lives under /App/data, which is a host bind mount at
# runtime, so anything COPYed there would be masked. Appending also means the
# theme needs no UserTheme setting and applies to anonymous pages like /Login.
#
# The .br/.gz siblings are not served by this app (it uses UseStaticFiles, not
# .NET 9 MapStaticAssets — verified against a running instance), but they are
# removed anyway so a future upstream upgrade cannot start serving the stale
# pre-brand copies.
# THE GUARD, and it is the reason a green build here means anything.
#
# `>>` CREATES a missing target. Rename site.css upstream and this append lands
# in a brand-new orphan file, the version sed below still succeeds, both
# placeholder greps still pass, and the image publishes GREEN — to everyone who
# pulls `latest`. Their instance then has no theme, and there is no
# error anywhere to find. Same for shared.js below, where the cost is the whole
# navbar and the vehicle dashboard.
#
# TWO checks, because there are two ways to lose the file. `test -s` catches the
# rename and the truncation. The marker grep catches the REWRITE, where the path
# still exists and no longer holds what we are extending — and the marker is a
# thing the brand layer actually depends on rather than a nonce: roadtrack.css
# hides the Household entries inside `.lubelogger-mobile-nav`, so if upstream
# drops that class our rules match nothing whether or not the append worked.
#
# Proven to fire — both files, rename and rewrite — by tools/test_build_guard.sh,
# which CI runs as the build-guard check.

# The "Metrics" nav link rides along the same way, appended to the js/shared.js
# that _Layout.cshtml loads on every page. Same reasoning as the theme: it
# keeps the link in git and in the image, and needs no Razor fork and no proxy
# rule to put a tab in the navbar.
#
# The metrics page's own assets carry no upstream `?v=`, so without a stamp they
# would sit at a URL that never changes between releases — the exact trap that
# once hid a CSS release behind a cached copy. Substituting this repo's VERSION into
# the tags AND every ES import means each release busts its own cache. shared.js
# is stamped too, because the vehicle dashboard it now loads is referenced from
# there rather than from a page this repo owns.
#
# The final greps fail the build if a placeholder is ever left unsubstituted, so
# a renamed file cannot silently ship a literal "__RT_VERSION__" to browsers.
#
# EVERY text asset under brand/, found rather than listed. The list was the
# maintenance hazard it looks like: adding brand/metrics/finance.js
# meant remembering to add a line here, and the only thing that would have
# caught it is the grep two lines below — a build failure rather than a bad
# image, but still a build failure for a reason nobody would enjoy diagnosing.
# The -name filter keeps sed away from the PNGs and the .ico.

# Same guard as the theme, same reasoning — see above. `printContainer` is the
# marker because reports.js calls window.printContainer directly; if it is gone
# the Reports tab's print button is dead whatever this append did.

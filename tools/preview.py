"""Local preview harness for the injected UI and the vehicle dashboard.

Serves the brand layer with a mock LubeLogger API so the dashboard can be
rendered and eyeballed without real vehicle data. Upstream's own bundles
(bootstrap, jQuery, chart.js, the themed site.css) are pulled once from a
running Road Track container and cached under /tmp/rt-preview-cache — delete
that directory to fetch them again.

    docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/spencernorton/roadtrack:latest
    python3 tools/preview.py [port]      → http://127.0.0.1:8899/

An image built from this repository (`docker build -t roadtrack-local .`)
works just as well. RT_UPSTREAM points the harness at any other instance
(default http://127.0.0.1:8080); only anonymous static files are fetched, so
it needs no login and no data.

Not shipped in the image; a development tool only.

 *
 * Appended to wwwroot/js/shared.js at image build time, the same trick the
 * theme uses with site.css: shared.js is loaded by _Layout.cshtml on every
 * page, so this needs no proxy rule and no Razor fork.
 *
 * Three jobs: add the "Access" tab, replace the vehicle Dashboard with our own
 * renderer, and rewrite the three "LubeLogger" strings that are compiled into
 * the Razor views.
 *
 * Those three strings used to be nginx `sub_filter` rules on the reverse
 * proxy. They moved here because a proxy's configuration is easily
 * regenerated from a template — adding a second hostname, or re-running
 * whatever writes it, silently drops hand-added rules and serves
 * "LubeLogger" again. In JS the branding follows the app to any hostname and
 * any proxy. Old sub_filter rules left in place are harmless: they run
 * first, and these replacements then find nothing.

       absent, which is exactly the wanted behaviour; it has no branch for a

       setInterval hunting an element that will never appear.

     * activate the pane or fire `shown.bs.tab` — which is the event our lazy
     * loader is waiting on. Net effect: clicking a Road Track tab does
     * absolutely nothing. No pane, no error the user can see, no clue.
     *
     * That is how Collaborators, Reports and Finance each once shipped dead,

     * The SAME id on both navbars is deliberate and is upstream's own
     * convention — `report-tab` appears in the tab bar and in the phone menu,
     * and the two selectors above are exactly how upstream tells them apart.
     * Matching it also means the twin button now picks up `.active` like every
     * other tab, which it never did before.
     *
     * AND IT MUST CONTAIN NO HYPHEN BEFORE "-tab" — `rtfinance-tab`, not
     * `rt-finance-tab`. vehicle.js:94 writes the active tab into the URL through
     *
     *     getTabNameForURL = (name) => name.toLowerCase().split('-')[0]
     *
     * and reads it back as `${param}-tab`. So `rt-finance-tab` is pushed as
     * `?tab=rt` and comes back as `#rt-tab`, which does not exist: all three of
     * our tabs collapse to the same param, and RELOADING the URL upstream just
     * put in your history activates nothing at all — a blank vehicle page, with
     * `waitForElement` parked on a setInterval hunting `#rt-tab` forever (188

     * metrics now measure ownership from it. What upstream has no field for is
     * the mileage the car showed that day — which is what every per-distance
     * figure has to count from on a vehicle bought second-hand. If the
     * previous owner put 60,000 miles on it, then without a starting reading
     * those miles are in the denominator of this owner's cost per mile.
     *
     * Added as a LubeLogger EXTRA FIELD rather than as a fork. saveVehicle()
     * harvests every `.extra-field` in the open modal by reading its <label> for
     * the name and its <input> for the value (getAndValidateExtraFields in
     * shared.js), so a div in that shape is validated and persisted by
     * upstream's own save path with nothing hooked and nothing patched. It
     * comes back out of /api/vehicles under `extraFields`, which is where
     * aggregate.js reads it.
     *
     * Once saved, upstream renders the field itself — at the TOP of the form,
     * where it reads as unrelated to the purchase date it belongs with. So the
     * existing node is MOVED into the panel rather than a second one added:
     * two inputs with the same label would both be harvested and whichever sat
     * later in the DOM would silently win the save.

     * three are extra fields, harvested and saved by upstream's own
     * getAndValidateExtraFields() with nothing hooked.
     *
     * Names are the storage keys — they must match LOAN_FIELDS and
     * VALUATION_FIELD in aggregate.js exactly, because the harvester reads the
     * <label> text as the field name.
     *
     * EVERY BOX IS type="text" WITH AN inputmode, INCLUDING THE MONEY ONES.
     * This is upstream's own convention for anything with a separator in it —
     * `inputPurchasePrice` is `type="text" inputmode="decimal"` — and the reason
     * is that `<input type="number">` SILENTLY DISCARDS a value it cannot parse.
     * A deposit stored as "2,000" put back into a number input comes out empty,
     * so reopening the form and saving wiped it: the exact data loss the refill
     * below exists to prevent, reintroduced by the input type. Measured, not
     * assumed — four of five fields came back and Down payment did not.
     * aggregate.js's typedNumber() strips separators anyway, so text costs
     * nothing and guarantees whatever was stored round-trips verbatim.
     *

     * would like to be one — the harvester does `$(elem).find("input")`, so a

           re-syncs the DOM to what Bootstrap believes and the panel closes
           again. Measured on the real modal — open at 1.2s, shut by 3s, with no
           `hide.bs.collapse` event to show for it, which is exactly how the

           in, the panel latched shut over an "Odometer at purchase" that was
           still empty, and the field became unreachable without knowing to
           expand a collapsed accordion to look for it. That is precisely how
           this fails: date filled in, reading still blank, field
           nowhere to be seen.

           Still keyed on those TWO only, now that four more fields live in the
           panel. The loan and valuation boxes are optional — most vehicles will
           never have them filled in — so including them would wedge the

     *
     * Hardly anybody types a receipt into a form. They photograph it, or
     * forward the email it arrived in — so if the instance's operator runs
     * something that files receipts from a Telegram bot or a mailbox, the
     * person standing in the garage with a receipt should not have to know
     * that it exists. Nothing in upstream's UI can say so; this button does.
     *
     * One button, fixed at the bottom-right of the garage and of every
     * vehicle page, opening whichever channels are configured. On a phone the
     * Telegram link opens the app straight into the bot; on a vehicle page it
     * carries `?start=v<id>`, so a bot that reads its /start payload can file
     * the next photo against that car without asking "Which vehicle?". The
     * mailto puts the car in the subject, the same hint for a mailbox.
     *
     * CONFIGURED AT RUN TIME, because the image is the same for everyone. The
     * entrypoint writes the ROADTRACK_RECEIPT_* environment variables to
     * /brand/config.json; with neither channel set there is no button at all,
     * since a menu with nothing in it is worse than no menu. `no-cache`
     * revalidates rather than refetches, so a restart with new values shows
     * up on the next page load without a version bump.
     *
     * Appended to <body>, not to either navbar — this is the one surface that
     * needs no counterpart in the phone menu (see addMobileItem), because it
     * is not a tab. z-index sits under Bootstrap's modal backdrop (1050) and
     * upstream's phone menu (2000), so it never floats over either. The menu
     * is Bootstrap's own dropup, driven by data-bs-toggle with no code here.
     *
     * Deliberately links and nothing more. A receipt-first upload in this app
     * would need a service next to it holding an extraction key; the bot and
     * the mailbox already are that service.

     * inserts the /Home/Garage partial with `$("#garage-tab-pane").html(data)`,

     * loading="lazy" afterwards, from a MutationObserver, changes the
     * attribute and nothing else: the fetch has already started (measured on
     * a 1.7.3 container — an offscreen poster patched that way was fetched,
     * the same poster with the attribute in its markup was not). So the
     * attribute goes into the HTML string, through jQuery's htmlPrefilter,
     * which both the innerHTML and the append path of `.html()` call.
     *
     * Scoped to strings that are a garage partial, so no other image in the
     * app changes how it loads. The partial is upstream's own Razor output,
